In "Decision_Tree_Titanic.ipynb", I build a decision tree classifier to predict survival of passengers on the Titanic.

In "github_scrape_EDA_MBA.ipynb", I scrape data from the CU Boulder course catalogue, clean the data, and compile a csv. I also perform anlysis on COVID-19 data, visualize this data, and perform market basket analysis.  

In "GabeWallonA02.ipynb", I scrape job posting data from Linkedin and calculate summary statistics (part B). I also answer some basic questions regarding statistical measurements.
