# Data-Mining-Python
Recent Data Mining coursework:  

"SP24_DM_Gabe_Wallon_Exam2B.ipynb" was the final take-home exam from the semester. I create a data cleaning/preprocessing pipeline and apply several data analysis and modeling methods: outlier analysis, PCA, decision trees, logistic regression, parameter tuning, K-means clustering, and data visualization. 

In "classification_models.ipynb", I use Decision trees, Logistic regression models, KNN models, and SVMs to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent. I also use these same models to predict whether a patient will develop diabetes. Then I compare the models. 

In "Decision_Tree_Titanic.ipynb", I build a decision tree classifier to predict survival of passengers on the Titanic.

In "github_scrape_EDA_MBA.ipynb", I scrape data from the CU Boulder course catalogue, clean the data, and compile a csv. I also perform anlysis on COVID-19 data, visualize this data, and perform market basket analysis.  

In "GabeWallonA02.ipynb", I scrape job posting data from Linkedin and calculate summary statistics (part B). I also answer some basic questions regarding statistical measurements.     

In "GabeWallonA01PartB.ipynb", I scrape data from "The Guardian" and compile it into a csv.
